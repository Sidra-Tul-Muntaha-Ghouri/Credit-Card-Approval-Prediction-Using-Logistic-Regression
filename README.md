# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
In this project, I've applied logistic regression model to forecast whether or not a credit card application will be approved.

##The Project involves the following steps:
1. Loading dataset
2. Dataset Inspection
3. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
4. Missing Values Handling
5. Preprocessing the data
6. Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
7. Making predictions and evaluating performance
8. Using grid searching to improve model performance
9. Finding the best performing model


The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
