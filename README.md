# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
In this project, I'll use logistic regression to forecast whether or not a credit card application will be approved.
The Project involves the following steps:
1. Loading dataset
2. Inspection
3. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
4. Missing Values Handling
5. Preprocessing the data
6. Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
7. Making predictions and evaluating performance
8. Using grid searching to improve model performance
9. Finding the best performing model

We'll start by loading and inspecting the dataset.
We will see that the dataset contains both numerical and non-numerical features, as well as values from various ranges and a number of missing elements.
We will need to preprocess the dataset to ensure that the machine learning model we choose can generate acceptable predictions.
We will undertake exploratory data analysis after we have clean data to establish our intuitions.
Finally, we will develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not a credit card application will be approved.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
